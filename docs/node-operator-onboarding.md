## WCN Node Operator onboarding 

### Get `wcn_node` binary

Depending on your infrastructure either pull the docker image
```
docker pull ghcr.io/walletconnectfoundation/wcn-node:1.451.2
```
or build the binary from source
```
cargo build -p wcn_node --release
```
After a successful build the binary will be located in `target/release` folder.

### Generate cryptographic keypair

```
cargo run -p wcn key generate
```
It will show you the following (**DO NOT use these example values for your node**)
```
Key 0
Private key: pKESPDecF6OB27qj5/JBKNeyBBdLyv8rkw+cgtjlc6E=
Public key: eMTmrtqEJKIUDvVgRx6igMJrxMJfTx6VE6KFdhsqZKo=
Peer ID: 12D3KooWHwoETeshEo4sNSLHv1Hoppq7au87kkDyzhQtgvSjacCR
```

You will need `Private key` in the following configuration section. Store it in a secure place, and make sure you won't lose it.  
Your `Peer ID` needs to be provided to the WalletConnectFoundation and to be whitelisted in order for your node to be able to join the network.
`Peer ID` is similar to `Public key` and is a public information which may be freely shared.

### Configure the node

Configuration is being done via environment variables.
Here's the list of the required ones:

```bash
# Your private key, previously generated by `wcn key generate`
export SECRET_KEY=$your_private_key

# Your public IPv4 address, each time your IP changes this variable needs to be updated.
export SERVER_ADDR=$your_public_ipv4_address

# The name of your organization, ex. "MyOrg".
export ORGANIZATION=$your_organization_name

# Identifier of the geographic region in which your node is going to be deployed.
# Available values: eu, us, ap.
export REGION=$region

# Directory in which the database data is going to be stored.
# It MUST be persistent.
export ROCKSDB_DIR=$rocksdb_dir

# Directory in which the consensus data is going to be stored.
# It MUST be persistent.
export RAFT_DIR=$raft_dir
```

The following section depends on the network: Mainnet / Testnet.   
**Make sure to select the correct network you're connecting to.**

<details>
  <summary>Mainnet</summary>
  
  ```bash
  # Identifier of the network.
  export NETWORK_ID=mainnet
  
  # For the initial launch of your node (bootstrap) you also need to specify a list of peers to connect to.   
  export PEER_12D3KooWFJpHSpFCoHqFJsHyc9JA7C9XPTVhyXsiTRucU6TikGWe=<Ask the team for the correct address>
  export PEER_12D3KooWDdSQWrrkcxs6JGcWYHygwQ4zyoK4SR6Y58f7dsmXsXyp=<Ask the team for the correct address>
  export PEER_12D3KooWNhADaVPZFcRLxvbfp8abbuPLFz9NGxkh75aHivPHnjyP=<Ask the team for the correct address>

  ```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Testnet</summary>
  
  ```bash
  # Identifier of the network.
  export NETWORK_ID=testnet

  # For the initial launch of your node (bootstrap) you also need to specify a list of peers to connect to.   
  export PEER_12D3KooWDBZx6LibN1Lxvtb45yFNBfons96bn79AokA2amcJpcZd=<Ask the team for the correct address>
  export PEER_12D3KooWDfseE1zdkdPjhwHYfdSUSRZ5mGJoUTNUbiyehWrMDhDM=<Ask the team for the correct address>
  export PEER_12D3KooWJTtT7wUsqWtcGufQrYCcPm8s5vHib9cCVZWiVUKMJz5a=<Ask the team for the correct address>
  ```
</details>

Optional configuration variables you may also be interested in:
```bash
# Port of the Raft API server.
export RAFT_SERVER_PORT=3010

# Port of the Raft API server.
export REPLICA_API_SERVER_PORT=3011

# Port of the Coordinator API server.
export COORDINATOR_API_SERVER_PORT=3012

# Port of the Admin API server.
export ADMIN_API_SERVER_PORT=3013

# Port of the Prometheus metrics server.
export METRICS_SERVER_PORT=3014

# Port of the Migration API server.
export MIGRATION_API_SERVER_PORT=3015
```

### Prepare your infrastructure

#### Firewall

`Raft API`, `Replica API` and `Migration API` server ports need to be open for all connections in your firewall settings.  
Default ports are `3010`, `3011` and `3015`, however you can change them as described in the previous section.

#### Graceful shutdown

WCN nodes require large graceful shutdown timeout to be configured, depending on the network condition the node may refuse to shutdown after `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` for quite some time.  
Node orchestration is being managed internally by the network itself, if there's an ongoing data migration your node may be forbidden from shutting down. Also, there's a limit on how many nodes can be offline at the same time.   

This is required to achieve high availability.

So, you need to make sure that your infrastructure won't `SIGKILL` the WCN node prematurely.  
WalletConnectFoundation nodes are configured to have `12h` graceful shutdown timeout. But we expect other operator nodes to have at least `1h` of graceful shutdown window.
